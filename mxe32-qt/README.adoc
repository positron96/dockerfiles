# mxe-qt

This is a docker container that includes MXE toolchain for building windows applications inside docker for CI/CD purposes.
It includes a compiler, linguist tools and qt5base and qt5serialport packages. 
Packages are for x86 (i686) static flavors.
Packages are installed from MXE debian repository (https://pkg.mxe.cc/repos/apt/client-conf/mxeapt.gpg).

Other packages can be added easily, provided `pkg.mxe.cc` is up. Example of installation:
```
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install mxe-i686-w64-mingw32.static-qtcharts
```

# Usage example (for GitLab CI/CD yaml)

Build project that is in current directory:

```
docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/src mxe-qt "qmake && make"

```

or just `docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/src mxe-qt` (it does the same `qmake` and `make`)

Most probably, the binary will end up in `./release`
